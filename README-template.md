## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

This was quite a tricky project, especially having to figure out how to overlap the elements in desktop view without the use of the z-index. The z-index I discovered prevented the use of hover effects on my "Continue" button. I found the responsive section of the project to be quite tricky too. I still have not 1005 actually figured this out. 

### Continued development

For my next projects, I definitely want to place focus on ensuring that I unesratnd the position proeprties as well as media queries.
